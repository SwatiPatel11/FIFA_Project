# FIFA_Project to better understand Inferential Statistics & Linear Regression

Problem Statement
You are a data scientist who wishes to make it big by becoming a football club manager. A rich club has decided to hire you as their manager. You have all the money to build a team from scratch.

Your aim is to find out the best squad for the upcoming football championship.

About the Dataset:
Snapshot of the data you will be working on:

data

For this task, we have only taken the required columns and the data has already been cleansed for better analysis

A zipped file containing the following items is given:

train.csv :
The data file train.csv contains the 14384 instances with the 9 features including the target feature.




test.csv" :
The datafile test.csv contains the 3597instances with the 8 features excluding the target feature.




sample_submission.csv :
Explained under the Submission sub-heading




DataDictionary.csv:
The file contains data dictionary(Dictionary explaining what each feature of the dataset means) of the dataset




FIFA_Project_student_template.ipynb :
A template notebook explaining the task breakdown to solve the given problem statement (Learners are recommended to use it)

Submission
After training the model on train.csv data, the learner has to predict the target feature of the test.csv data using the trained model. The learner has to then submit a csv file with the predicted feature.

Sample submission file(sample_submission.csv) is given to you as a reference to the format expected when you submit

Evaluation metrics
For this particular dataset we are using r2 score as the evaluation metric.

Submissions will be evaluated based on r2 score

Your r2_score score	Points earned for the Task
r2_score>= 0.80	100% of the available points
0.80 < r2_score <= 0.76	80% of the available points
0.76 < r2_score < 0.73	70% of the available points
r2_score <= 0.73	No points earned
Outcomes
The main objective of this task is to provide you with an open field where you can practice and work your way with a dataset end to end without any restrictions from our side. So feel free to play around the model until you arrive at your best solution.

In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Linear Regression
MSE andR^2R 
2
 Evaluation Metrics


After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a linear regression model.

Skills Covered:
data cleaning
Linear Regression
Data hormonization
sklearn
